# Explanation of the Advanced Calculator Code with Graph Plotting Support

---
## Introduction

This Python program implements an **Advanced Calculator** with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library. It supports various mathematical operations including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, factorials, percentages, and constants like Ï€ and e. Additionally, it features a **graph plotting** capability that allows users to plot mathematical expressions containing the variable `x` over a specified range.

The code is structured as a class `AdvancedCalculator` that extends `tk.Tk`, organizing the GUI creation, input handling, expression evaluation, and graph plotting within its methods.
